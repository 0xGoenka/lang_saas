1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,560
so have you all noticed that everything

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,240
kind of sucks now and I don't mean like

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,620
the general state of the world I mean

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,020
like the stuff we buy is just like a

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,820
little bit worse than it was 10 years

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,740
ago and I really started thinking about

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,540
this because my co-worker Izzy wrote

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,580
about how she had to replace a bra so

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,440
I'm gonna do it any normal person would

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,660
do which is by the exact same thing from

11
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,760
the exact same place and then after a

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,740
few weeks it just kind of just kind of

13
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,680
fell apart so this kind of started me on

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,960
like this journey of like okay I'm

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,699
hearing anecdotally from like so many

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,560
people that I talk to like in my life

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,739
from coffee machines phones computers

18
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,980
sweaters they all tear or break or like

19
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,860
explode way sooner than they used to so

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,660
what's going on and is there a way to

21
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,399
climb out from under this pile of

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,340
consumer trash

23
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,100
foreign

24
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,360
so let's talk about this in the most

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,980
basic of terms starting with the design

26
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,199
process when a company wants to make a

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,079
thing let's say like a jacket there are

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,600
three main factors to consider

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,699
functionality does it work appearance

30
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,880
does it look good and manufacturability

31
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,520
is it easy and fairly inexpensive to

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,200
make a lot of this product

33
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,420
generally a good product will have a

34
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,939
good blend of these three things but in

35
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,439
recent years this process has been

36
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,360
thrown off balance let's look at clothes

37
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,180
for example in the past if you needed a

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,860
new jacket you used to go to a tailor

39
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,200
get measured choose a material and have

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,240
it made then for decades instead of

41
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,860
going to a tailor for a jacket we went

42
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,420
to department stores and bought things

43
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,820
that were mass produced by the 80s and

44
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,280
90s we had tons of options in stores to

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,100
choose from and now many of us just kind

46
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,979
of go online click add to cart and buy a

47
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,159
product without ever seeing it in person

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,740
but it's not just how we buy it's how

49
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,500
often we buy and for that we can kind of

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,820
blame this man

51
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,220
Ernest Elmo yeah incredible name in the

52
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,560
1930s during the Great Depression he

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,600
wrote this paper that was like okay like

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,619
the government should really like

55
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,740
support this idea of plan obsolescence

56
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,540
except he didn't call it planned

57
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,640
obsolescence he called it consumer

58
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,740
engineering remember that jacket you

59
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,239
bought well it's a new season and it's

60
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,459
out of style buttons are out zippers are

61
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,739
in so you buy something new but not

62
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,180
because there was anything physically

63
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,099
wrong with the original that's why it's

64
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,780
called consumer engineering right like

65
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,760
it was it's up here in the brain and

66
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,140
we've been living this way for decades

67
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,879
so now we all want the next best thing

68
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,700
all the time and that demand has spun

69
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,920
out of control

70
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,920
today we are surrounding the speed of

71
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,300
certain Trend cycles and the fact that

72
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,739
they're geared towards like these micro

73
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,319
communities like Stanley Cups when like

74
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,120
maybe a year ago it was like Hydro

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,080
flasks the result is that we buy a lot a

76
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,879
survey done in 2021 and found that

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,220
nearly 40 percent of UK consumers buy

78
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,099
clothing as often as once a month the UN

79
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,319
reports that between the year 2000 and

80
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,900
2014 the average person was buying 60

81
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,599
more clothing and each item was only

82
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,840
kept half as long so we want to buy a

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,580
lot of stuff fast and because we replace

84
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,860
our stuff so often we don't really want

85
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,140
to spend a lot of money on it which has

86
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,540
an effect too people aren't willing to

87
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,220
pay more for something they have

88
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,800
purchased a while ago so like if I paid

89
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,280
30 bucks for a bra 10 years ago it would

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,019
be really hard for me to buy it at fifty

91
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,239
dollars even though in the last 10 years

92
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,640
labor costs have risen so what we're

93
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,379
left with is an incredibly fast cycle of

94
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,420
demand for low-cost products and here's

95
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,459
what that looks like in order to speed

96
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,140
up manufacturing companies have to

97
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,120
either hire more people alter how the

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
product is made or both but they also

99
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,780
have to keep prices low enough for

100
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,420
consumers to keep buying so they may

101
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,760
start swapping materials like cotton or

102
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,940
silk for a cheaper synthetic material or

103
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,739
rely on a more basic stitching pattern

104
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,959
that maybe just doesn't hold as well

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,420
so if after 10 years you're still paying

106
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,519
the same price or close to the same

107
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,920
price for a product that looks the same

108
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,400
well something had to change

109
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,159
so you might say okay Kim fashion trends

110
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,260
are moving too fast and we buy too much

111
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,180
stuff I get it I get it but why does my

112
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,819
washing machine suck and that's a great

113
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,599
question let's talk about technology

114
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,580
when things like computers first became

115
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,320
part of our daily lives it made a lot of

116
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,660
sense to upgrade devices pretty often it

117
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,579
was actually very big differences in

118
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,740
what a device did that's two years old

119
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,900
versus one that was brand new in the

120
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,060
market there was just big leaps this is

121
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,560
gay Gordon Byrne she directs the

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,000
consumer advocacy group called The

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,860
repair Association you know if you had a

124
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,840
two-year-old thing you probably couldn't

125
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,180
do half the cool stuff that the other

126
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,759
guy could do so that kind of fueled the

127
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,100
replacement cycle because you really did

128
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,680
get something better in terms of

129
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,720
functionality for example when the

130
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,639
iPhone was first made it was a major

131
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,160
breakthrough subsequent phones up to a

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
point responded to Major technological

133
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,520
leaps like look at the difference

134
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,100
between the 3Gs and the four the iPhone

135
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,380
4 had a way better resolution and a

136
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,000
front-facing camera

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,460
for a while these major leaps between

138
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,100
models was the norm for technology but

139
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,740
we're not making those giant changes as

140
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,860
often anymore instead partly to make us

141
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,660
want to buy more things companies make

142
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,540
very minor adjustments year after year

143
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,520
so the drier you own may now play a fun

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,840
little song at the end of a cycle

145
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,120
instead of screaming and now as devices

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,740
Advanced and got increasingly

147
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,360
complicated there was another problem

148
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,340
for consumers all these things started

149
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,500
to come into the into the world they

150
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,840
didn't come in with repair tools they

151
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,600
came in to be thrown away basically when

152
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
this stuff breaks it's often

153
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,139
intentionally impossible to repair

154
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,180
because if you buy something that has a

155
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,800
computer chip in it or a circuit board

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,740
or whatever you probably can't make one

157
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,740
in your garage so you're very you're

158
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,720
very reliant on what the manufacturer

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,120
will agree to sell and very often they

160
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,039
don't agree to sell parts and tools and

161
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,139
Diagnostics or even give you a diagram

162
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,300
but sometimes it really just isn't

163
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,580
possible to fix because they cut Corners

164
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,160
just like in fashion replacing metal and

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,620
screws with plastic and glue and these

166
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,780
kind of issues apply across the board in

167
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,539
technology from your phone to toasters

168
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,720
to blenders to electric wheelchairs to

169
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,060
your car if you walk around your your

170
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,680
house or your apartment and you start

171
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,960
cataloging how many things you own that

172
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,520
have chips in them I think you'd be

173
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,440
really surprised how big

174
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,100
that lack of repair problem actually is

175
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,840
I want people to feel hopeful yes this

176
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,280
is something that's like out of our

177
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,080
control in some ways and not out of our

178
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,520
control in others I don't want you to

179
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,460
feel guilty for like partaking in in

180
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,139
this system when like so many people

181
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,300
even kind of brought up culturally to

182
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,220
think in this way or to buy in this way

183
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,199
compared to other things that suck in

184
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,639
the world we actually have a surprising

185
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,139
amount of control over this situation

186
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,660
with tech fighting for the Rachel repair

187
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,660
is actually extremely effective New York

188
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,699
State just passed away to repair bill in

189
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,100
2022 and it's not perfect but at least

190
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,380
it's something with fashion stay away

191
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,300
from micro Trends and fast fashion as

192
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,639
often as you can buy with intention and

193
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,020
learn to take care of the things you do

194
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,900
have think of like your objects as

195
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,460
having maintenance read those care

196
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,979
labels as consumers it's gonna take a

197
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,360
little bit for us to sift through all

198
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,340
the trash and retrain our brains a bit

199
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,560
but we can take small steps to take back

200
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,199
control of the process after all all of

201
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,380
this stuff is supposed to be made for us

202
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,330
so let's make it clear what we want

203
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,580
[Music]

204
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,400
we have a map on our repair.org website

205
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
where you can go find your state click

206
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
the picture and it'll bring up a um a

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,660
basically a letter writing widget you

208
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,940
type in your address and it says

209
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,340
tell your repair story and if you really

210
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,139
want to do something that's how it gets

211
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,419
done we've had over a hundred thousand

212
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,060
people do that over 30 000 of them in

213
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,099
New York so it does not surprise me that

214
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,419
New York was the first one to actually

215
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,680
pass law

216
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,720
because that's where there was a really

217
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,979
big ground swell of Interest
