1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,167
I love that feeling when

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,252
it's the beginning of fall

3
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,795
and it's 55 degrees outside

4
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,505
and it's finally cold enough 
to wear my favorite 

5
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,590
winter sweater and jacket 
and beanie and gloves.

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,051
And I drink pumpkin spice lattes 
to stay warm.

7
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,470
But I also love the feeling when 
it's the middle of winter

8
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,389
and out of nowhere it's 55 degrees.

9
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,724
So I leave my parka home

10
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,392
and go outside in my 
shorts and t-shirt

11
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,935
and I feel the warmth of the 
sun on my skin.

12
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,813
And I consider going to the beach
to tan because it's so warm.

13
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,565
The temperature is the same

14
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,942
but my reaction to it 
is vastly different.

15
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,360
Part of the reason why

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,572
is that there's more of a substance
in my body in January

17
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,740
as compared to September.

18
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,992
It's the same substance that allows 
kids and teens

19
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,911
to handle the cold weather 
better than adults.

20
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,875
When you're hot, 
you sweat.

21
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,418
When you're cold, 
you shiver.

22
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,878
But just before you start 
to shiver

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,838
your body actually does something else.

24
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,465
It starts to burn fat...

25
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,091
but not the fat we 
usually think of.

26
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,344
There are two categories of fat 
that we like to think about.

27
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,512
There's the white fat.

28
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,807
White fat is the one that we tend to 
just think of as “fat”.

29
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,393
It's called white because 
it looks white.

30
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,103
White fat exists all throughout the body

31
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,855
cushioning our bones and organs.

32
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,107
That's Dr. Aaron Cypess, 
by the way.

33
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,359
White fat cells have many functions

34
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,652
one of the most important being that

35
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,654
they're the body's primary 
energy source.

36
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:15,617
Every single day we are 
using the fuel

37
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,203
that's inside the 
white fat cells.

38
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,412
But there's another type of fat

39
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,082
that has a totally different function: 

40
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:22,707
Brown fat. 

41
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,459
These cells are much smaller

42
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,003
and because of that, resemble 
muscle more than fat.

43
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,380
Instead of one large 
lipid droplet 

44
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,800
in a white fat cell, 
the brown fat cell

45
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,303
is one tightly packed bag 
of mitochondria.

46
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,514
This is what gives it 
its brown appearance.

47
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,183
And if you remember anything from 
high school biology class...

48
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,436
you know that the mitochondria
are the powerhouse of the cell.

49
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,650
Brown fat, instead of serving as an energy
reserve for organs

50
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,859
throughout the body to burn,

51
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,529
uses its power to burn energy 
on its own.

52
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,822
And unlike white fat

53
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,158
it's only located in a few 
tactically positioned areas.

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,453
It is in the neck, the shoulders, 
in the upper arms.

55
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,039
It's down the spine and then 
some places within the belly.

56
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,250
Lots of overlap with major blood vessels

57
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,419
because warming the blood effectively warms the whole body.

58
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,463
The brown fat around the neck vessels

59
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,340
heats up the blood,
goes to the brain.

60
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,924
That's good.

61
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,551
The brown fat depots 
in the shoulders

62
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,928
that blood, once it's been 
heated by the brown fat

63
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,472
goes right — very quickly,
into the heart

64
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,724
and then can get pumped 
to the rest of the body.

65
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,144
And that's the first line of defense 
against the cold.

66
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,105
If it's not enough to raise the body
temperature sufficiently...

67
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,107
then the body shivers.

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,692
But one of the craziest things

69
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,694
that I learned while researching 
this story is that...

70
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,612
babies can't shiver.

71
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,531
When babies are born

72
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,534
they do not have the muscle mass

73
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,244
and perhaps not even 
so much of the coordination

74
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,788
with the brain and the muscle 
to shiver effectively.

75
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,624
So they need other ways 
of generating heat

76
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,084
and brown fat is part of that.

77
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,378
Babies are born with 
a lot of brown fat.

78
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,255
According to the Cleveland Clinic

79
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,674
about 2 to 5% of a baby's body weight 

80
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,009
is made up of this stuff.

81
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,052
It's necessary for our survival.

82
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,554
The peak age for brown fat

83
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,598
actually seems to be in the teen years

84
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,725
which explains why a lot of the guys 
in my high school

85
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,393
wore shorts in the winter.

86
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,645
But as we get older, our body 
makes less of it.

87
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,023
And this could give us 
some insight into

88
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,316
why kids seem to run hot

89
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,943
and our parents or grandparents 
seem to run cold.

90
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,695
Older people...

91
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,239
they certainly have much less 
brown fat...

92
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,783
in terms of absolute 
and relative amounts.

93
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,160
There's also less muscle

94
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,120
which is also important
for generating heat.

95
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,289
The similarities between 
brown fat and muscle

96
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,832
don't end there, though.

97
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,169
If you work your brown fat out, 
it also increases volume.

98
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,963
And the way you do this is 
by exposing yourself

99
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,424
to the cold for extended periods of time...

100
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,093
as this 2014 study shows.

101
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,763
Look at how much more brown fat 
these men from Maryland

102
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,432
had after a month of exposure 
to cold temperatures.

103
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,601
And look how much less they had

104
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,603
when exposed to warm temperatures.

105
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,522
Which gives us some insight into 
why 55 degrees in the winter

106
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,649
can feel so much warmer

107
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,943
than 55 degrees in the fall.

108
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,237
Brown fat doesn't just 
keep you warm, though.

109
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,864
Scientists have figured out 
that having more of it

110
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,909
correlates to lower risk of 
diabetes and heart disease.

111
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,869
Studying the effects of brown fat

112
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,538
using cold exposure 
is challenging, though.

113
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,875
One challenge is that 
it's hard to dose cold.

114
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,086
How much... I gave you ‘this’ amount of cold.

115
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,462
I mean, you know the temperature, but

116
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,505
it's hard to know what you're doing

117
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,839
and therefore it's very hard to design a study

118
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,048
where it's reproducible.

119
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,007
So instead

120
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,677
they're trying to activate 
brown fat with medicine

121
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,597
to study how burning it 
affects us biologically.

122
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,641
A medication called Mirabegron

123
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,560
which is approved to treat 
overactive bladder

124
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,396
was able to activate the brown fat

125
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,814
in a way that was very similar

126
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,024
to the effectiveness of the cold exposure.

127
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,735
There's a lot we still don't know about brown fat...

128
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,654
but we do know that our bodies

129
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,656
use it to adapt to cold weather.

130
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,367
And when a kid doesn't want 
to put a coat on in the winter

131
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,744
it’s not necessarily that 
they're just stubborn.

132
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,663
It might just be because they have 

133
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,331
a little more of something 
in their body 

134
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,541
than you do.
