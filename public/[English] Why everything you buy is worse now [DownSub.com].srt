1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:02,302
So have you all noticed that 
everything kind of sucks now?

2
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,170
And I don't mean, like, the 
general state of the world.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,473
I mean, like, the stuff we buy 
is just, like

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,075
a little bit worse than it was 
10 years ago.

5
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,844
And I really started thinking about this 

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,847
because my coworker Izzie wrote about 
how she had to replace a bra.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,416
So I'm gonna do what any normal person would do

8
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,919
which is buy the exact same thing from the exact same place.

9
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,121
And then after a few weeks

10
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,055
it just kind of...

11
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,056
Just kind of fell apart.

12
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:26,559
So this kind of started me
on this journey of

13
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,366
okay, I'm hearing anecdotally from 
so many people I talk to

14
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:31,631
in my life.

15
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:32,999
 From coffee machines...

16
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,635
phones, computers, sweaters...

17
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,203
They all tear or break

18
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,973
or explode way sooner 
than they used to.

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,608
So what's going on?

20
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:42,809
And is there a way to climb out 

21
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,512
from under this pile of consumer trash?

22
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,951
So let's talk about this in the most 
basic of terms

23
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,553
starting with the design process.

24
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,388
When a company wants 
to make a thing

25
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,490
let's say, like a jacket

26
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,759
there are three main factors to consider.

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,895
Functionality: Does it work?

28
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,963
Appearance: Does it look good?

29
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,166
And manufacturability: 

30
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,602
Is it easy and fairly inexpensive 
to make a lot of this product?

31
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,839
Generally, a good product will have a good blend

32
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,040
of these three things.

33
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,341
But in recent years

34
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,243
this process has been thrown off balance.

35
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,312
Let's look at clothes, for example.

36
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,514
In the past, if you needed 
a new jacket

37
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,583
you used to go to a tailor,
get measured

38
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,885
choose material and 
have it made.

39
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,388
Then for decades, instead of going 
to a tailor for a jacket

40
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,656
we went to department stores 

41
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,891
and bought things that were mass produced.

42
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,026
By the 80s and 90s

43
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,695
we had tons of options and stores to choose from.

44
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,032
And now many of us just kind of go online

45
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,134
click "add to cart" and 
buy a product

46
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,436
without ever seeing it 
in person.

47
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,507
But it's not just how we buy, 
it's how often we buy.

48
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,076
And for that, we can kind of 
blame this man.

49
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,745
Ernest Elmo, yeah,
incredible name. 

50
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,914
In the 1930s, during the Great Depression

51
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,883
he wrote this paper
that was like

52
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,052
"Okay, the government 
should really support

53
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,721
this idea of planned obsolescence."

54
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,090
Except he didn't call it planned obsolescence.

55
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:06,626
He called it "consumer engineering."

56
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:07,861
Remember that jacket you bought?

57
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,829
Well, it's a new season, and it's out of style.

58
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,663
Buttons are out.

59
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,598
Zippers are in.

60
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,099
So you buy something new.

61
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,534
But not because there was anything

62
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,336
physically wrong with the original.

63
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,438
That's why it's called consumer engineering, right?

64
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,373
Like, it's up here in the brain.

65
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,041
And we've been living this way 
for decades.

66
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,711
So now we all want the next best thing, all the time.

67
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,113
And that demand has 
spun out of control.

68
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,617
Today we are surrounded.

69
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,786
The speed of certain trend cycles and 
the fact that they're geared

70
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,288
towards these micro communities.

71
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,158
Like Stanley cups, when maybe a year ago

72
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,859
was Hydro Flasks.

73
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,328
The result is that we buy a lot.

74
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,766
A survey done in 2021 found that nearly 
40% of UK consumers

75
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,169
buy clothing as often as once a month.

76
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,139
The UN reports that between 
the years 2000 and 2014

77
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,009
the average person was buying 60% more clothing...

78
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,945
and each item was only kept half as long.

79
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,581
So we want to buy a lot of stuff fast

80
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,449
and because we replace our stuff so often

81
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,952
we don't really want to spend a lot of money on it...

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,154
which has an effect too.

83
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,223
People aren't willing to pay more

84
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,659
for something they had purchased a while ago.

85
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,863
So like if I paid 30 bucks 
for a bra, 10 years ago

86
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,265
it would be really hard for me to buy it at $50.

87
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,735
Even though in the last 10 years labor costs have risen.

88
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,804
So what we're left with 
is an incredibly fast

89
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,806
cycle of demand for low cost products.

90
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,441
And here's what that looks like.

91
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,343
In order to speed up manufacturing

92
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,212
companies have to either hire more people

93
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,813
alter how the product is made 

94
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:34,314
or both. 

95
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,882
But they also have to keep prices

96
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,951
low enough for consumers to keep buying.

97
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,720
So they may start swapping materials

98
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,790
like cotton or silk for a cheaper synthetic material.

99
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,593
Or rely on a more basic stitching pattern

100
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,895
that maybe just doesn't hold as well.

101
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,332
So if after 10 years, you're still paying 
the same price

102
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,201
or close to the same price for a product
that looks the same...

103
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,238
well, something had to change.

104
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,473
So you might say,

105
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,142
"okay, Kim, fashion trends are moving too fast

106
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,311
and we buy too much stuff. I get it. I get it."

107
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,447
"But why does my washing machine suck?"

108
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,415
And that's a great question.

109
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,384
Let's talk about technology.

110
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,753
When things like computers 

111
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,388
first became part of our daily lives

112
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,124
it made a lot of sense to upgrade devices pretty often.

113
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:21,660
There was actually very big differences in what a device did

114
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,964
that's 2 years old versus one that 
was brand new in the market.

115
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,532
There was just big leaps.

116
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,800
This is Gay Gordon-Bryne.

117
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,903
She directs a consumer advocacy group 
called the Repair Association.

118
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,639
You know, if you had a 2 year old thing

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,341
you probably couldn't do 
half the cool stuff 

120
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,676
that the other guy could do.

121
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,344
So that kind of fueled

122
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,980
the replacement cycle because you really did

123
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,350
get something better in terms of functionality.

124
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,619
For example, when the iPhone was first made

125
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,721
it was a major breakthrough.

126
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,189
Subsequent phones up to a point

127
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,125
responded to major technological leaps.

128
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,694
Like look at the difference between 
the 3GS and the 4.

129
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,764
The iPhone 4 had a way better resolution

130
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,033
and a front facing camera.

131
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,934
For a while, these major leaps

132
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,170
between models was the norm for technology.

133
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,441
But we're not making those giant changes as often anymore.

134
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,678
Instead, partly to make us want to buy more things...

135
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,480
companies make very minor adjustments year after year.

136
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,949
So the dryer you own may now play

137
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,719
a fun little song at the end of a cycle 
instead of screaming.

138
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,688
And now, as devices advanced

139
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,389
and got increasing complicated

140
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,058
there was another problem 
for consumers.

141
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,027
All these things started to come into the into the world.

142
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,396
They didn't come in 
with repair tools.

143
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,398
They came in to be thrown away.

144
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,367
Basically, when this stuff breaks.

145
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,236
It's often intentionally impossible to repair.

146
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,872
Because if you buy something that has a computer chip in it

147
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,908
or a circuit board or whatever

148
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,610
you probably can't make one in your garage.

149
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,347
So you're very reliant on

150
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,515
what the manufacturer will agree to sell.

151
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,051
And very often they don't agree to sell parts

152
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,154
and tools and diagnostics or even give you a diagram.

153
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,257
But sometimes it really just isn't possible to fix

154
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,626
because they cut corners, just like in fashion

155
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,563
replacing metal and screws with
plastic and glue.

156
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,166
And these kind of issues apply 
across the board in technology...

157
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,436
from your phone to toasters to blenders...

158
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,172
to electric wheelchairs to your car.

159
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,008
If you walk around your house or your apartment

160
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,243
and you start cataloging

161
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,445
how many things you own that have chips in them

162
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,782
I think you'll be really surprised how big that

163
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,951
lack of repair problem actually is.

164
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,120
I want people to feel hopeful.

165
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,621
Yes, this is something that's

166
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,123
out of our control in some ways

167
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,691
and not out of our control in others.

168
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,727
I don't want you to feel guilty for partaking in...

169
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,563
in this system where like so many people, we've been kind of

170
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,866
brought up culturally to think in this way 

171
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,501
or to buy in this way.

172
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,336
Compared to other things that suck in the world

173
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,071
we actually have a 
surprising amount of control

174
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,339
over this situation.

175
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,608
With tech, fighting for the right to repair

176
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,710
is actually extremely effective.

177
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,347
New York State just passed the right to repair bill in 2022

178
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,916
and it's not perfect but at least 
it's something.

179
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,085
With fashion, stay away from 
micro trends

180
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,120
and fast fashion as often as you can.

181
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,055
Buy with intention and learn to take care

182
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,557
of the things you do have.

183
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,527
Think of your objects as having maintenance.

184
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,961
Read those care labels.

185
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,397
As consumers, it's going to take a little bit for us

186
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,200
to sift through all that trash and retrain our brains a bit.

187
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,902
But we can take small steps

188
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,937
to take back control of the process.

189
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,808
After all, all of this stuff is supposed to be made for us.

190
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,810
So let's make it clear what we want.

191
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,315
We have a map on our
repair.org website

192
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,050
where you can go find your state...

193
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,185
click the picture...

194
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,222
and it'll bring up a—basically, 
a letter writing widget.

195
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,558
Type in your address
and it says...

196
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,393
Tell your repair story.

197
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,161
And if you really want 
to do something

198
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,629
that's how it gets done. 

199
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,132
We've had over 100,000
people do that.

200
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,301
Over 30,000 of them 
in New York.

201
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,836
So, it does not surprise me that 

202
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,971
New York was the first one to
actually pass a law.

203
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,106
Because that's where there was

204
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,242
a really big groundswell of interest.
