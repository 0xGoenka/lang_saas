1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,025
Welcome to my crib!

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,828
Do you want a tour?

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,360
This is my bedroom.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,400
This is my living room.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,520
This is my kitchen.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,360
And this is my bathroom.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,161
Because I...

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,853
am in this.

9
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:23,102
There’s a whole AirBnB category 
just for shipping containers.

10
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:24,960
And behind that is a couple of things.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,681
There's this fantasy that you buy 
a shipping container for $4,000 

12
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:30,900
bring it to a mountain, and you’re happy.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,240
You’re happy now.

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,240
And the other is that if 
you want affordable housing

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,724
containers homes are the answer according 
to this, and this, and this, and this...

16
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:42,895
So is it true?

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,132
No.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,748
About a week ago I drove through a 
ton of fog Warrenton, North Carolina

19
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:57,395
to stay in a shipping container.

20
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:04,025
I brought some food props to make some elaborate
shipping container models out of graham crackers

21
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,240
which my editor was skeptical that I could pull off

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,080
but I told her that I used to 
have a graham cracker addiction.

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,062
So...

24
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:12,868
full proof. 

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,880
And then I got to my house.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,600
No, the one behind that one.

27
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,200
After I bonded with other 
guests, owner Michael pulled up

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,991
who built this development with a tiny house,
another shipping container, and my house.

29
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:34,715
It's your home for tonight.

30
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:40,000
Were you nervous cutting such a big hole?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,764
I really believe in my team, you know, and they 
will tell me if they believe they can't do it.

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,490
To really re-emphasize, this 
is considered a real house.

33
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:55,311
Later on, propped up agains the house, I found 
the cut out pieces of my actual container.

34
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:57,047
That is very cool.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,660
You can actually see some of 
the printing of the container.

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,640
That creativity is the promise 
of shipping containers,

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,639
which I was gonna demo with my graham 
crackers, and it started out great...

38
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,352
Look! I did it!

39
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:13,625
But...

40
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,316
No! No, no. No.

41
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,738
You were right.

42
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,320
Here are the supposed pros behind 
the shipping container home.

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,607
It’s standardized.

44
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:28,468
This one’s 40 by 8. 320 square feet.

45
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,127
That means they’re stackable.

46
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:33,958
They can be modified with a 
simple cut through the steel.

47
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:36,948
And you can just crane them... anywhere.

48
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,480
They’re also super strong because 
these things are made to carry stuff

49
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
in big stacks across the ocean.

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,301
And best of all, you can get them super 
cheap because containers are everywhere.

51
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,920
It's still raining a bit and I'm 
totally hopped up on sugar now.

52
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,247
So I thought I'd give you some reflections 
on my first night in the shipping container.

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,727
It's pretty interesting.

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,068
I definitely don't notice the size element.

55
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:05,520
I don't feel constrained by that at all.

56
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,505
And the way that Michael made the bathroom 
large makes it pretty easy to get comfortable.

57
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:17,301
There's this lock on the garage door 
that you kind of... click shut.

58
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:19,748
Makes it feel like a panic room.

59
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:20,986
Which I actually like.

60
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,400
Because it makes me feel like I'm important.

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,053
It's like a good hotel room with 
a real creative touch to it.

62
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,936
I'm going to go to sleep now.

63
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:34,560
But something cool isn't necessarily practical.

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,401
Or easy.

65
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:40,000
Before I partied all night long 
in Warrenton, North Carolina.

66
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:41,762
Just gonna eat this bad boy...

67
00:03:42,591 --> 00:03:44,800
I talked to two people about 
whether shipping containers 

68
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,382
are practical affordable housing

69
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:49,668
or if they're kinda of overrated.

70
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:52,640
One is Belinda Carr, an architect 
who has a Youtube channel

71
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,960
that racks up huge views for videos 
 about stuff like insulation

72
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,650
and actually went viral with a video that
wasn’t super positive about shipping containers.

73
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,640
And I talked to Mark Hogan, an 
architect who wrote an article  

74
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,440
7 years ago about shipping containers 
and is still part of the big debate.

75
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,472
There's no debate. I mean... they're garbage.

76
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,440
It was a very old argument 
when I wrote the article and  

77
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,570
someone keeps recycling it every six months.

78
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,360
It comes from me in architecture school.

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,160
Almost every year they were 
pushing this idea of modularity...

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,520
the idea that a home, each part 
of a home could be a different box

81
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,640
and you could just switch out the 
box if you wanted to expand the home.

82
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,400
And and we were kind of brainwashed in that sense.

83
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,640
Everyone. I'm talking about 
everyone in architecture school.

84
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,880
And then I got to the real world and I 
started like diving into building science

85
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,880
how things are constructed, not just 
how things look, but how they function.

86
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,960
Slowly, this argument about modular 
shipping container construction fell apart.

87
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,000
It's an interesting look. And it appeals to people
because it seems logical.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,601
As long as you don't think about 
it for more than 5 minutes.

89
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,600
One of the first thing you see 
with these houses is stacking.

90
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,640
The way containers work is 
they have these four major  

91
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,800
structural points in the ends of the container.

92
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,062
They're supposed to bear most of 
the weight on those four footings.

93
00:05:23,062 --> 00:05:27,680
So when you see them on a ship out in the 
ocean, they're all stacked vertically.

94
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,760
Once you start offsetting 
it or turning it at an angle

95
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,240
no other part of the container is truly structural 
or can bear the weight of the container.

96
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,920
So you have the reinforce it.

97
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,240
The same goes for cool windows, 
and doors, and garages.

98
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,280
When you cut a hole, you need to reinforce.

99
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,239
The container itself has made 
it a very thin, flimsy metal.

100
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:51,840
But because of the geometry 
and the corrugations...

101
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,160
it basically functions as a box 
beam that that makes it stronger, 

102
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
which is why you can lift it up with a crane

103
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,742
and put it on to a ship.

104
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:05,840
As soon as you start cutting holes in it, it no 
longer functions structurally as a beam anymore.

105
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
If you are able to get labor for 
all that to a remote location,

106
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,480
you’ll still need to build a 
foundation for your container 

107
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,800
to clear building codes and be stable.

108
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,200
That could be a slab, or piers, 
and then it’s stuck there.

109
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
And you need utilities too.

110
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,680
So this is actually with a real 
foundation, and it’s concrete piers.

111
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,880
And then we welded the shipping 
container onto the piers itself

112
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,960
So this is actually considered 
a house on a very small scale.

113
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,440
Modular design is great, but to make it livable,  

114
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,400
you have to add expensive, and 
pretty permanent, insulation.

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,921
So we took a shipping container, 
we did spray in insulation...

116
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,780
and then we put the tin over that insulation.

117
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,920
And then it met the code requirements.

118
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,840
The thing that I responded to in the article

119
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,200
is the idea that it was a solution 
to building low cost housing, 

120
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,120
which is usually what it's presented as.

121
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,268
And it's clearly not that.

122
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:06,320
The overall project’s not 
very expensive for a house, 

123
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,184
but per square footage it adds up.

124
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,690
Okay, so shipping containers are 
so bad, why are they still a trend?

125
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,600
I came to the conclusion that as affordable 
modular housing they're wildly overrated.

126
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,945
But as cool, fun things to stay 
in and to design... they work.

127
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,960
Also, I went on Getty images and, yea...

128
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,324
shipping container housing for 
Ukrainian refugees is a thing.

129
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,502
It definitely makes sense for 
temporary, really fast housing.

130
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:42,044
But as an environmental or 
affordable housing solution?

131
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,484
The next morning, I had breakfast.

132
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:49,324
I slept well, I mean, I felt very safe

133
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:56,180
because I've literally seen all the entrances
and exits hanging against a wall.

134
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,282
It was, go to sleep and take a really nice shower.

135
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:03,280
They had a double shower and heated floor.

136
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:05,092
Let's get some jam on here.

137
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:08,800
I finished my graham cracker nachos and packed up.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,520
Later, at home, I went on 
Vox Media's music service 

139
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
and searched for a song that was bittersweet.

140
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,339
I don't think I've ever met anyone 
who built something

141
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:26,265
out of shipping containers who said 
they would do it again.

142
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:30,000
The obsession I think is that people 
think they've come up with a workaround.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,919
And then they don't want to be proven wrong.

144
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,868
And so they just dig deeper 
and deeper into this hole.

145
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,736
I think humans have this 
obsession with modularity.

146
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,823
It's this vision people have in their head of

147
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:49,680
"oh, if I want to grow my home 
or if I want a larger bathroom,

148
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,228
I can switch out this container 
and bring in another container."

149
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:55,920
And the idea that if my home wants to grow,  

150
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,560
I can add in two more containers 
and it can grow that way.

151
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,168
How did you feel when you 
first saw them on the site.

152
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:06,610
There was a sense of excitement, 
but then I looked at my bank account

153
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,788
and was immediately disappointed.

154
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:11,600
Because I realized it was 
really going to be a challenge.

155
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,120
You have to be a little naive and 
arrogant to do something like this 

156
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,505
because it is a lot more work and 
money than you initially expect.

157
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
Warrenton, North Carolina is a tiny town but it’s  

158
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,734
known for the revival Greek and 
Roman architecture they built.

159
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,840
It's kind of artificial.

160
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,060
Car.

161
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,960
In the same way that shipping containers are  

162
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,588
a form but they aren’t 
necessarily practical to live in

163
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:48,754
all these columns don’t make it easier 
or more functional

164
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,880
but they did connect the people of 
Warrenton to a cultural legacy that existed.

165
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,742
And that’s kinda what we do 
with shipping containers too.

166
00:09:55,742 --> 00:10:00,960
I mean, we live with stuff that is moved 
around in these things, all the time.

167
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,305

them to our daily lives.

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,247
It might not be practical to live 
in them, but it might be meaningful.

169
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,372
Even if it’s not as easy as it seems.
