export const london = `1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,120
London, is prone to severe flooding.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,240
Like the disastrous 1928 Thames 
Flood that displaced thousands.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,280
And the notorious 1953 North Sea storm that 
killed over 2,000 people throughout Europe.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,560
"By far the biggest event was 1953. 
And it's the biggest natural hazard  

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,320
to affect the UK sort of in the last 200 years."

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,440
Since then, this region hasn’t experienced 
such catastrophic floods, mainly due to this.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,320
The Thames Barrier: A storm surge 
defense system that opened in 1984.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,135
"The barrier, which stretches for a third of a mile across the Thames at Woolwich,

9
00:00:36,135 --> 00:00:38,672
is the largest structure of its kind in the world."

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,360
So, how has the Thames Barrier 
protected London for this long?

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,175
And, in a world where flooding 
is more and more common,  

12
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:51,446
how will the Thames Barrier adapt to keep up?

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,080
The Thames Barrier is unique. It's 
the first movable barrier ever built  

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,040
in the River Thames and protects 
the most populous part of London.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,080
As the second largest 
movable barrier in the world,  

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,560
it’s made up of 10 steel gates that 
span 520 meters across this river

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,960
The outer four gates always have 
their barriers up and closed.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,120
And these central, larger six gates are 
left open most of the time to let ships  

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,680
pass through and for the river to flow naturally.

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,800
So what triggers the closing 
of the rest of the barrier?

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,806
"Another storm ...

22
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:36,190
Batters the United Kingdom ... 

23
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,022
Severe weather is not going away."

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,840
The UK's environmental agency, which monitors 
the North Sea's tide levels, river flow,  

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:51,160
and weather, gathers data on a daily basis to 
determine whether to open or close the barrier.

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,920
When the decision is announced, 
the gates can begin closing. It  

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,080
takes about 90 minutes to close all the 
gates, which can go as high up as 20m.

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,960
And they’re designed to withstand 
over 9,000 tons of gushing water,  

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,080
which is the equivalent of 
almost 118 large swimming pools.

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,280
The gates remain closed for 
high tide for about four to five hours.

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,160
Once the flood recedes, the gates are 
lowered to their resting position.

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,202
The general idea is that the gates block 
the gushing water to protect the city.

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,880
"The Thames Barrier alone protects  

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,280
1.42 million people, 320 billion 
pounds of residential properties.

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,641
We had a very, very big storm in 
2013, Storm Xaver. 

36
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:43,865
No one died,  and one of the reasons why 
that was was because of forecasting, 

37
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:48,220
but also as a direct result of these 
storm surge barriers being built."

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,528
In the year of Storm Xavier, the barrier 
was closed 50 times. 

39
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:59,840
For perspective, in the entire decade of the 80s, it 
was closed a total of four times.

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,480
The more the barriers open and 
close, the faster they deteriorate. 

41
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:10,333
And experts fear that climate change will 
disrupt tide predictability in the UK.

42
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,920
"Sea level rise is the most 
certain and probably the most costly  

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,720
consequence of climate change. And 
we've already seen a 25 centimeter  

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,960
increase in sea level over the last 
100, 120 years."

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,760
To prepare for that getting worse, the UK 
put together the Thames Estuary 2100 plan:

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,800
A plan to upgrade London’s 
flood defense systems that  

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,980
recognizes that we don’t actually know 
how bad climate change is going to get.

48
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,080
And it was a very novel, 
very unique plan in that rather than  

49
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,440
sort of just a static adjustment 
to account for sea level rise,  

50
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,280
they actually took an adaptive approach and 
they said, look, we don't know exactly what  

51
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,600
the future holds. We're going to put a 
series of plans in place that can adapt.  

52
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,376
So we know we need a new Thames Barrier, 
but we don't know exactly when.

53
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:02,160
We think we need a new barrier in 2070,

54
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,200
but if sea levels rise faster than normal, we 
can bring that plan forward.

55
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,880
The Thames Estuary 2100 plan 
ultimately comes in three phases.

56
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,399
From now until 2035, the main priority 
is to maintain what exists already.

57
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,957
Like the Thames Barrier, by ensuring it can 
still withstand the pressure of high tides.

58
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:29,920
The plan acknowledges that we don’t yet know how 
much higher they’ll need to be raised,  

59
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,400
and leaves room for variability.

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,720
After 2070, the third phase will again examine 
the effects of climate change on London;  

61
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,880
if water levels are increasing at alarming rates,  

62
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,320
more interventions like 
additional barriers may be added.

63
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,880
The success of the Thames Barrier has 
inspired the creation of more than 50  

64
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,920
additional flood barriers around the world, 
protecting millions of people from disaster.

65
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,080
But according to experts, the most 
impressive part isn’t the Thames  

66
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,200
Barrier itself, but the UK government's 
willingness to adapt for the future.

67
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,400
"And now countries all around the world 
are sort of copying that approach from  

68
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,000
small towns to big cities like New 
York and taking this more sort of  

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,667
adaptive approach. And that was 
very much pioneered in London.
