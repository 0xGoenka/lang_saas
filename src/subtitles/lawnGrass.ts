1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:02,210
This is the American dream.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,381
A nice house with a lush, green,
well manicured lawn.

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,260
Lawns take up more land
in the US than any individual crop.

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:16,349
All told, they account for about 1.3%
of the surface area in the continental US.

5
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,477
Which is an area
larger than the state of Louisiana.

6
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,148
But the fact is, lawns are anything
but natural.

7
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:28,361
It takes a lot of hard work, resources,
and money to make a lawn and keep it

8
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,237
green.

9
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,240
And it's not even a plant
that's native to North America.

10
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:35,702
Even Kentucky
Bluegrass is actually from overseas.

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,748
So I can't help but wonder
why it's all you see, up and down

12
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,083
virtually every street in America.

13
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,919
And are there other options
than the quintessential

14
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,922
green lawn?

15
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,593
Originally, manicured turf grass

16
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,138
lawns came about in 18th century
England and France.

17
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:59,017
they were the domain of the ultra
privileged members of society.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,313
Since you were growing something that
couldn't be eaten or made into clothes.

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,813
In America, lawns

20
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:08,943
were popularized by influential figures
like George Washington and Thomas

21
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:13,323
Jefferson, who both styled their estates
after the fashionable British lawns.

22
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:17,243
The ideal of turf grass lawns
was furthered by people

23
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:21,623
like landscape architect Frederick
Law Olmsted, who designed massive

24
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:26,252
public parks
projects Central Park, Boston’s Fens,

25
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:30,965
as well as parks in Buffalo,
Milwaukee, and Chicago.

26
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,553
But green, well manicured lawns
remained in the sphere of public parks

27
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,971
and the homes of the wealthy,

28
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,974
because so many people
didn't own a house of their own.

29
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,268
But that was all about to change.

30
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,482
Starting in the 1930s, U.S.

31
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:51,986
government loan programs provided
mortgages for over 11 million new homes.

32
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:56,491
The federal government also built 48,000
miles of interstate highways,

33
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:01,079
which enabled Americans to access these
shiny new suburban housing developments.

34
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:05,458
Developments like Lakewood, California,
a suburban bedroom community where over

35
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,920
17,000
brand new single family homes sprang up,

36
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:12,090
To many, Lakewood was Paradise.

37
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,217
Lawns were heavily
marketed to this new middle

38
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:18,221
class of suburbanites
as luxurious reflections of status.

39
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,264
They told you that

40
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,434
if you had a beautiful lawn, it meant that
you were a smart, modern American.

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,107
One magazine article at the time said
it was, biggest lawn boom of all time.

42
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,569
It is literally spreading all over
and has become, in fact,

43
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,237
much more than a ground cover.

44
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:39,200
It is an emotion that has blossomed into
a status symbol.” I'll be totally honest.

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,994
I've never owned a lawn,

46
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,706
so I don't even know where you would start
to make a lawn that looks like this.

47
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,292
I called Dr. Nick Christians.

48
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,128
He literally wrote the
book on growing turf grass.

49
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,967
If you've got your timing right, 
and you know

50
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,970
a little bit about what you're doing,
you can do it with very little effort.

51
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,181
Digging through his book. Let's see.

52
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
You should start by testing your soil.

53
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,310
It says to do it every 3 to 5 years.

54
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,770
Or when your lawn is not up to snuff.

55
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,439
Then you got to fertilize.

56
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,400
He says the ideal is 3 to 5 times
annually.

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,027
Then you got to water the lawn.

58
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,154
He suggests twice a week.

59
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,031
Fescues. Blight. Drop spreaders.

60
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,034
Pre-emergent herbicides.

61
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,786
Point being, it's a lot.

62
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:28,166
The average American spends about 65 hours
a year on lawn and garden care.

63
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,920
And all this lawn care uses up
lots and lots of resources.

64
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:37,091
Lawn mowers in the US use 1.2 billion
gallons of gasoline every single year.

65
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,720
And it takes 1 to 2 in ches of water
a week to keep your lawn

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,723
lush and green,
which for 1000 square foot lawn.

67
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,184
That's over 10,000 gallons a summer.

68
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:50,230
in a more arid region, like here
in California, a single family can use up

69
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,192
to 87,000 gallons a year
just to water their lawn and garden.

70
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,570
That's the same amount of water
as four home swimming pools.

71
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,074
And all this lawn and garden equipment
emits tens of millions

72
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,077
of tons of pollutants into the environment
every year.

73
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,413
So turf grass is by far
the most common lawn covering,

74
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,959
but it seems like it's maybe not
the most environmentally friendly option.

75
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,921
So I had to wonder–
If you don't want a turf lawn, but

76
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,758
you also don't want an overgrown meadow
like this, what should you do?

77
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:23,012
I would not say that I'm anti lawn
but I'm anti lack of a better idea.

78
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,389
And thinking about what you want

79
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,392
your space to actually do
and serve you and your community.

80
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,395
Sarah is one of the people
trying to figure that out.

81
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,190
She's a landscape designer in San Diego,
and I decided to drive down to talk

82
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,816
to her.

83
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,819
She showed me some of the projects
she's worked on, where she converted

84
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,197
grass yards to more useful,
ecologically minded gardens.

85
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,033
And she showed me
a few of their key benefits.

86
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,704
Pretty much 99% of my clients
want low maintenance and low water.

87
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,747
So picking those plants isn't really hard.

88
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,332
There's a lot of California
friendly plants,

89
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,418
California
native plants that do well with that.

90
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,169
Treating your front yard

91
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,172
maybe even more like a backyard
where you have places to sit,

92
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,842
you have things to interact with,
you have a variety of things

93
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,220
can actually really be great
for a community A space like this offers

94
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,392
a lot more, interaction for kids, There's
so many things that are tangible here

95
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,603
that if a kid kicks this around,
they're not ruining your yard.

96
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:13,980
You just push back.

97
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,606
Cities

98
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:19,777
across the US are actually paying people
to convert their lawns from turf grass

99
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,947
to more sustainable, low
water use landscapes.

100
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,159
Here in L.A. You can get up to $25,000.

101
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,412
Sometimes I think
we try to stick to these perfect yards

102
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,457
and, you know, we're like,
don't touch it, don't interact.

103
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,460
But isn't that the opposite of the point?

104
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,754
For so long,

105
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,007
this is what people envisioned
when they thought of the American dream.

106
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,384
And for some, maybe it is.

107
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,262
It's the satisfaction of how it looks
when you're doing it rght.

108
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,222
When you get it right,
it really looks great.

109
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,225
Everybody comes by and wants
to know what you did and how you did it.

110
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:55,605
But for others, the American Dream
might be a yard that requires less work,

111
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,106
comprised of plants

112
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,485
that are actually native,
and that's better for the environment.

113
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,365
Maybe it's time we reimagine
what the American dream can look like.
